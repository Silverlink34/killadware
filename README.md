killadware.bat
==============
Functionality of each file:

killadware.bat: 
A very detailed batch file that uses Malwarebytes to scan computer, and then remove any left over adware that it misses.
I am constantly updating the script to incorporate more adware removal. I remove adware from clients computer on a daily basis
and document the removal process. This batch file just does it all for me.

dlmbam.vbs:
A script written specifically to download Malwarebytes installer version 1.75, and place it in C:\.

fsize.bat:
a simple batch file that outputs a filesize of any file in kbs. 
Simply running the batch will show size, but will close immediately. If combined with a command, 
you may import the data into a batch file and use accordingly.  
Usage: fsize.bat file.txt  Note: append "pause" to the end of the script to find out what data it is outputting.
